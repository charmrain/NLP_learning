    "# Assignment 1: Autocorrect\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of Course 2. This assignment will give you a chance to brush up on your python and probability skills. In doing so, you will implement an auto-correct system that is very effective and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probabilistic-models-in-nlp/supplement/saGQf/how-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

    "You use autocorrect every day on your cell phone and computer. In this assignment, you will explore what really goes on behind the scenes. Of course, the model you are about to implement is not identical to the one used in your phone, but it is still quite good. \n",

    "- Get a word count given a corpus\n",
    "- Get a word probability in the corpus \n",
    "- Manipulate strings \n",
    "- Filter strings \n",

    "- Understand how dynamic programming works\n",

    "- For example, if you type in the word **\"I am lerningg\"**, chances are very high that you meant to write **\"learning\"**, as shown in **Figure 1**. "

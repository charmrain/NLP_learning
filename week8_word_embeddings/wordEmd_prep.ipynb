    "# Word Embeddings First Steps: Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of ungraded notebooks, you'll try out all the individual techniques that you learned about in the lectures. Practicing on small examples will prepare you for the graded assignment, where you will combine the techniques in more advanced ways to create word embeddings from a real-life corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on data preparation, which is the first step of any machine learning algorithm. It is a very important step because models are only as good as the data they are trained on and the models used require the data to have a particular structure to process it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, import and initialize all the libraries you will need."

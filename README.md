# NLP_learning
this project is about my learning and practise in the topic of `NLP`

* week1
week1 is about using the logistics regression to conduct a sentiment analysis on tweets
the most intriguing feature is to:
1) use gradient descent to calculate the theta and see its improvement on iteration basis
2) vectorize the J or the cost function of logistics regression and theta = theta -alpha*delta
